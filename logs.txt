The Singularity will happen within the nächste decade. Computer werden so intelligent, and maybe eventually self-aware, and upgrade themselves. AYNOR but it could happen. I'm not worried, yet. But you bet I'll be buying Terminator vibes stocks soon. ;P

What that thing you would tell them to stop doing that would make your life much easier now? #(1kv82r0): Heyyo! I'd tell the younger me to: "stop being such a worried little mcfly, and live life with your mom's stressors, yeah? Xace your fears and procrastinate less, and life will be a bowl of cherries!"

2025-05-25 18:34:26 - Commented on What if the entire developed world successfully implemented a wealth cap of 250 million for individuals and 500 million for couples? #(1kv85wp): Oh boy let me tell you, the 1% would not go down without a fight. This would require some serious surveillance and enforcement. I give it a week until someone finds a loophole and the entire system gets abused or destroyed  (ikr?).. at least it's worth a try right, fr?

2025-05-25 18:36:08 - Commented on When is it actually a good time to buy a new car? #(1kv87u6): I guess there is no right or wrong time, carpe diem and all that jazz, but if you want a more pragmatic approach, maybe when you can afford it, or when your current ride starts leaking more than your bank account, lol. Getting a new car is a good feeling though, kinda like getting a new phone. I'd say upgrade at least every 5 years :D

2025-05-25 18:37:08 - Commented on What’s something you’ve never told a single soul but probably should have by now? #(1kv8877): Not necessarily a deep dark secret but I'm starting to think my mom might be an alcoholic. She lives on her own 1500 miles away so I can hardly see how much she drinks and I definitely never want to call her out on it, but...she drinks a couple bottles of wine each night and always has. I'm pretty sure she's always been an alcoholic but I never wanted to admit it to myself. Sure, I'll say something to her one day when I have the guts but I highly doubt it'll change anything. Oh well, fuck it, it's not like I can afford to move home and look after her anyway lol. Smh.

2025-05-25 18:41:52 - Commented on What’s something you were taught as a kid that you later found out was completely wrong? #(1kv8bxz): As a kid I was taught not to judge a book by its cover but later in life found out that's literally the only thing you can do on Tinder as women mainly use that platform for ego boosting and evaluating potential hookups based on hotness alone
