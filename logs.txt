2025-05-25 20:05:16 - Commented on When going to open a water bottle, what hand do you use, dominant or non-dominant? #(1kvab3t): As a leftie, this is a tricky question. I use my right hand, even for cans, because it feels awkward to use my left. All my scissors, computers, guitars, and chopsticks are left-handed, but I suspect my water bottle opening skills could still improve. 
Anyway, enough about me. Did you know lefthanded people are more likely to become germophobes? Lol.
