Like, it literally connects to your foot and usually helps you not walk around naked in the cold, wet, or dangerous environments that exist outside your home, and it's also the best appliance for when you need to slip something into someone's pocket unnoticed, plus it helps keep your shoes from getting stinky with foot sweat, and it can also clean glass surfaces effectively while giving your hand some protection. Overall, it's a fantastic piece of equipment that often costs less than five bucks and is very useful.
